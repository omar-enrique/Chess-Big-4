# Chess-Big-4
This project is a Chess game I coded from scratch playable on a 2-Dimensional GUI using the SFML API. The project is written in C++.
The reason this project is labeled "Chess Big-4" is because I aimed to implement the 4 Major Principles of Object-Oriented Programming in this program. These principles include: Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.  I also attempt at implementing a Multiplayer mode for the game so that two clients hosted by a local server can play each other.
